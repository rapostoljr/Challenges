# Reworking Horiseon Website to Meet Accessibility Standards

## DESCRIPTION

I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to make the coding more organized and easier on the eyes. Also, it helps me practice my coding and helps me to understand it better. If the code was kept the same as before, it would be a lot harder for those who do not understand code to find things. I created this project to help make the index.html and style.css more legible for others and make finding code easier. By organizing how the code is written and compressing it so all similar code is bundled together, it becomes easier to read and understand. By doing this, I learned how to compress code so that I do not have repetitive code taking up so much space. Also, I learned how to use the element selector to organize the code. My project stands out because I tried to identify every selector so you can see what each section is, instead of just seeing "div" everywhere.
